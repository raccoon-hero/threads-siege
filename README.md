An under 500 lines of code prototype **Threads Siege** made for a subject in uni, an arcade-style space defense game built with **Java Swing**. Players use their spaceship cannon to shoot down incoming alien enemies while avoiding letting too many enemies slip through.

## Features üåü  

- **Multithreaded Mechanics**: Each enemy and bullet runs independently on its own thread, allowing real-time movement and interaction.  
- **Dynamic Difficulty Adjustment**: The number of active enemies and their spawn rate automatically increase as the game progresses, based on the player's score and elapsed time.  
- **Collision-Based Scoring**: Bullets destroy enemies on contact, incrementing the score while missed enemies contribute to the game-over counter.  
- **Limited Ammo**: Players can have only three active bullets at a time, managed using a semaphore for concurrency control.  
- **Game State Feedback**: The UI dynamically updates to reflect the player's score and missed enemies, with win/lose conditions displayed at game end.

## Known Issues üëæ  

- **Thread Termination**: Active threads (e.g., enemies and bullets) are not guaranteed to terminate when the game exits, which may lead to memory leaks or lingering processes.  
- **Concurrency Management**: Shared resources like `enemies` and `bullets` are manually synchronized, which could cause subtle bugs under certain conditions.  
- **UI Scaling**: Game objects do not resize dynamically when the window size is changed, resulting in potential layout issues.  
- **Repaint Performance**: Under heavy load, the UI may experience performance drops due to frequent updates and rendering of multiple threads.  
- **Error Handling**: Exceptions such as `InterruptedException` are caught but not logged, which may hinder debugging.

## Future Plans ‚è©  

- **Thread Management**: Implement a proper cleanup mechanism for threads to ensure they terminate cleanly when the game ends.  
- **Improved Concurrency**: Replace manual synchronization with safer concurrent collections like `ConcurrentLinkedQueue` for managing enemies and bullets.  
- **Customizable Settings**: Introduce configuration options for adjusting game parameters such as enemy speed, bullet speed, and spawn rates.  
- **Graphics Scaling**: Add support for responsive scaling of game objects to adapt to window resizing.  
- **Performance Optimization**: Profile and optimize repaint intervals to reduce lag during heavy gameplay.  
- **Logging System**: Integrate basic logging to capture runtime exceptions and errors for debugging purposes.
